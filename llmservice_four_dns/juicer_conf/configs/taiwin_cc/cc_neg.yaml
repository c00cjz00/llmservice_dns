If it's set a positive number, the exported dataset will be split into several dataset shards, and the max size of each shard won't larger than the export_shard_size
# export_in_parallel: false                                   # whether to export the result dataset in parallel to a single file, which usually takes less time. It only works when export_shard_size is 0, and its default number of processes is the same as the argument np. **Notice**: If it's True, sometimes exporting in parallel might require much more time due to the IO blocking, especially for very large datasets. When this happens, False is a better choice, although it takes more time.

Rerun the same config will reload the checkpoint and skip ops before it. Cache will be disabled when using checkpoint. If args of ops before the checkpoint are changed, all ops will be rerun from the beginning.

op_fusion: false                                            # whether to fuse operators that share the same intermediate variables automatically. Op fusion might reduce the memory requirements slightly but speed up the whole process.
cache_compress:                                         # the compression method of the cache file, which can be specified in ['gzip', 'zstd', 'lz4']. If this parameter is None, the cache file will not be compressed. We recommend you turn on this argument when your input dataset is larger than tens of GB and your disk space is not enough.
